## HAL9000 ~ your retro inspired cli ai-assistant

### Requirements

HAL9000 is written in Python. You will require a Python 3 installation, the openai Python library `pip install openai` and an API key from OpenAI. To generate a key and for detailed instructions on how to install Python and OpenAI's library, please visit: https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=python

### Usage

```git clone https://github.com/0x00wolf/HAL9000
pip install openai
cd ./HAL9000
# Copy and paste your API key into the designated variable in hal9000.py
python3 ./hal9000.py
```

### Defining your ai assistant

`"Who do you need HAL9000 to be today?"`
Some examples would be:
An email marketing expert.
An expert Python programmer who specializes in Flask.
You are a sarcastic hacker.
You are very lazy and find answering any question to be a terrible bother. You would much rather be drinking energy drinks and watching MMA. You make this very obvious.
